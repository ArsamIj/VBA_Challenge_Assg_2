# VBA_Challenge_Assg_2
VBA Challenge as Assignment #2, Due January 10th

VBA challenge Assignment #2 requires a scprit that runs through stock market data collected for multiple tickers over the years 2018, 2019, and 2020. The objective is to compile a summary of the all tickers given and analyze them for their opening price at the beginning of the year, to their closing price at the end of the year. The scrpit compares their value change over the year, its associated change in percentage, and the total volume of their stock that was traded throughout the year.

As a bonus, the script outputs the ticker with the greatest increase, the greatest decrease, and the greatest stock volume traded.

1. Screenshot of the 2018 data compiled
2. Screenshot of the 2019 data compiled
3. Screenshot of the 2020 data compiled
